ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH PORTFOLIO PROJECT (RUBRIC GUIDELINES):
*completed* (at least) 4 IMAGES
*completed* logo
*completed* paragraphs
*completed* CSS media queries @media
*completed* flexbox
*completed* sematatic tags (header, footer,form,table this tells something about the content) non-semantic tags (div and span this doesn't tell anything about the content) are classified properly with ids and classes. 

NOTES ON THE JOURNEY:

MOBILE -> DESKTOP METHOD
Following the guidelines from the lessons and notes from various tutorials such as Matthew Crawford's and Joe Mesot's, I went for a MOBILE TO DESKTOP approach to making the site. This proved to be the best as I could easily play with the mobile support. The difficulty was in thinking up a proper min-width for the mobile to then jump to tablet and then to dekstop. I use tablet in the same way as medium between small and large screens as it can be the grey and more experimental area for when going from say 320px for an iphone to 720-1000pixels for a laptop. 

RESPONSIVE IMAGES:
Responsive images was an odd situation because it was a mixture of finding images of my projects (screencaps), and then customizing the size on photoshop. I gave certain elements such as header-img, featured-img, and a unique responsive-img classes to give them max-widths of 100px, 480px, and 100% (respectively) and heights at auto so that by the time I made breakpoints for bigger screens, they are responsive enough. So when I reached 720px, the point where the site stops growing and is fixed to that width size, the images have the proper height and widths to which I felt were decent for one to properly look at what I did. 

NOTE: The only hassel was trying to give them alternative images they could jump to for when they are at a certain height, the code would switch from the set image to another variation that's perhaps 50% as big or 75% as big. I'll have to look into this in the futre

NOTE: In the future, it would be best to have the images LINK TO the actual projects than give them links underneath.

MINOR BREAKPOINTS:
Although this wasn't a major factor, thinking about the size of my fonts was an neat element to work with by the time I made it to the end. Joe in his tutorial set different breakpoints where the font size was set to a viewport widths, ranging from 10-1, I decided to use this in order to help the process of going from big to small. I also went to Google Fonts for a font called Raleway to be the main font of my site.

REFLECTION:

Overall, this was a fun project, and something I'll continue to work on and improve. Hopefully I can make it more personal and add other criteria besides coding such as artwork I do on the side.
